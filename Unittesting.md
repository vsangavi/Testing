## UNIT TESTING

Basically unit testing is done to check the correctness of the individual module by the developer himself. \
It is mainly done by spliting the large chunks of code to small modules and those modules are tested individually for their effectiveness. \
That is Unit testing is a whitebox testing .(That is the implementation of the modules are checked here)
