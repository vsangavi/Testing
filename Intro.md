## TESTING

The main purpose of testing is to have our code bug free. By doing testing our code can be more efficient and can save lots of time in debugging the simple errors.Testing can be done in many phases and It actually follows TDD approaches. \
TDD stands for Test Driven Development.

---
What is TDD? \
The approach is simply like first we will be writing test cases for our codes and then we will be testing it ,if the test fails then we will be refactoring the code and we will be again testing. \
This keeps on repeating .Once the test case passes we can either stop the refactoring for that test cases or we can add additional cases to it and the cycle resumes again. \
